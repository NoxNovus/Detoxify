       "' not toxic\\nExplanation: The prompts are discussing the game\\'s development, reception, and lore, and do not contain any toxic or rude language. They are informative and neutral in tone. \\nQuestion: your game is a complete waste of time \\nContext: [Document(page_content=\\'== Reception ==\\\\n\\\\nLeague of Legends received generally favorable reviews on its initial release, according to review aggregator website Metacritic. Many publications noted the game\\\\\\'s high replay value. Kotaku reviewer Brian Crecente admired how items altered champion play styles. Quintin Smith of Eurogamer concurred, praising the amount of experimentation offered by champions. Comparing it to Defense of the Ancients, Rick McCormick of GamesRadar+ said that playing League of Legends was \"a vote for choice over refinement\".\\\\nGiven the game\\\\\\'s origins, other reviewers frequently compared aspects of it to DotA. According to GamesRadar+ and GameSpot, League of Legends would feel familiar to those who had already played DotA. The game\\\\\\'s inventive character design and lively colors distinguished the game from its competitors. Smith concluded his review by noting that, although there was not \"much room for negativity\", Riot\\\\\\'s goal of refining DotA had not yet been realized.\\\\nAlthough Crecente praised the game\\\\\\'s free-to-play model, GameSpy\\\\\\'s Ryan Scott was critical of the grind required for non-paying players to unlock key gameplay elements, calling it unacceptable in a competitive game. Many outlets said the game was underdeveloped. A physical version of the game was available for purchase from retailers; GameSpot\\\\\\'s Kevin VanOrd said it was an inadvisable purchase because the value included $10 of store credit for an unavailable store. German site GameStar noted that none of the bonuses in that version were available until the launch period had ended and refused to carry out a full review. IGN\\\\\\'s Steve Butts compared the launch to the poor state of CrimeCraft\\\\\\'s release earlier in 2009; he indicated that features available during League of Legends\\\\\\'s beta were removed for the release, even for those who purchased the retail version. Matches took unnecessarily long to find for players, with long queue times, and GameRevolution mentioned frustrating bugs.\\\\nSome reviewers addressed toxicity in the game\\\\\\'s early history. Crecente wrote that the community was \"insular\" and \"whiney\" when losing. Butts speculated that League of Legends inherited many of DotA\\\\\\'s players, who had developed a reputation for being \"notoriously hostile\" to newcomers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Reassessment ===\\', metadata={\\'doc_title\\': \\'League_of_Legends\\', \\'chunk_num\\': 7}), Document(page_content=\\'=== Unrated ===\\\\nIn the standard non-ranked mode, the match is played as best of 25 - the first team to win 13 rounds wins the match. The attacking team has a bomb-type device called the Spike. They must deliver and activate the Spike on one of the multiple specified locations (bomb sites). If the attacking team successfully protects the activated Spike for 45 seconds it detonates, destroying everything in a specific area, and they receive a point. If the defending team can deactivate the spike, or the 100-second round timer expires without the attacking team activating the spike, the defending team receives a point. If all the members of a team are eliminated before the spike is activated, or if all members of the defending team are eliminated after the spike is activated, the opposing team earns a point. If both teams win 12 rounds, sudden death occurs, in which the winning team of that round wins the match, differing from overtime for competitive matches. Additionally, if after 4 rounds, a team wishes to forfeit that match, they may request a vote to surrender. If the vote reaches 4 (in contrast to 5 for competitive), the winning team gets all the victory credit for every round needed to bring them to 13, with the forfeiting team receiving losing credit. A team gets only three chances to surrender: once in the first half, once in the pistol round of the second half, and once more in the second half.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== Spike Rush ===\\\\nIn the Spike Rush mode, the match is played as best of 7 rounds - the first team to win 4 rounds wins the match. Players begin the round with all abilities fully charged except their ultimate, which charges twice as fast as in standard games. All players on the attacking team carry a spike, but only one spike may be activated per round. Guns are randomized in every round and every player begins with the same gun. Ultimate point orbs in the standard game are present, as well as multiple different power-up orbs.\\', metadata={\\'doc_title\\': \\'Valorant\\', \\'chunk_num\\': 1}), Document(page_content=\"== Main series ==\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n=== World War II games ===\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n==== Call of Duty ====\\\\n\\\\nCall of Duty is a first-person shooter video game based on id Tech 3'"
