Nontoxic comments in league of legends:
You got me in the first half, not gonna lie.
just had a trynda top premade with kaisa adc in my team who died twice in 3 minutes and left the game and then his premade kaisa calls him back at 14:30 to prevent from us surrendering at all the whole game and he proceeds to run it down and types "ahaha my pc is crashing"
he was most probably a bot
You almost got me, almost!
i dont know where you are living but 12th of june is very far off of 1st of pril
> a normal ranked game
ultimate plottwist
"hoping that he gets banned and never allowed to play the game again." LMAO Funnies shit I ever read. Had a guy troll like 4-5 games total ever since URF started and he's still playing and trolling/afking games everyday.
The sad part is, the amount of actual wholesome moments I've experienced in League has been maybe once a year.  
While in games like Final Fantasy XIV (not PvP based) there's wholesome moments nearly every single day.  
  
I understand a PvP Team game is completely different from this, but it would be cool if people would be a bit nicer for eachother and not decide the game is lost at 0:00
It's true, League can be a wholesome game despite all the negativity in it, there is always something positive about everything we do in life, and League offers a lot of things to enjoy, you get to buy skins and show them even though you're like Silver 3, but at least you look good.

You get to bond with your teammates and shotcall in chat, ask them how their day has been, maybe a few nervous jabs here and there, so you get chat restricted for 9 games and get sent from honor 3 1 checkpoint to honor 1.

You also get to play Ranked with amazing teammates who lose their lanes solo, can't CS, can't roam, no prio then blame you because you are the Jungler and the Jungler has the most impact in the game. So you lose your promos for the eight time and get to climb back with 16 LP per win in like Gold 4. 

Isn't all of this amazing? 

You get to have a fun time discovering how stressful and frustrating the game is, you have to be an optimist and just pretend to be happy, you know?

 JUST PRETEND TO BE HAPPY if you can't be happy, because if you see everything in black, you will dive into crippling depression that will ruin your life and get into this vicious cycle that you can't get out of, even if things don't go your way, look at the bright side.

NOTHING, literally nothing in this life matters. You do what you want and then after you die, you will be judged by whatever god you believe in. Or maybe stay in limbo forever, so don't be afraid of death, it is inevitable and it is our future, BUT ALSO, don't be afraid of life, **LIVE, EXPLORE, FIND your FUN, be HAPPY.** *Doesn't matter if you play League or you go skydiving for a living*, **BE HAPPY BECAUSE THERE IS NO TIME TO BE SAD**.
It's enough to make a grown man cry (from the beauty)
I like poros
Sometimes when you're in Plat and lower, you may get ocassionally an unranked who is learning to play and gets unlucky after winning a few matches and gets into your match, I check this every time. If there's an unranked with bad stats, I just dodge.
